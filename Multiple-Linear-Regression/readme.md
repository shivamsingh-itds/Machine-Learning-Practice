### Linear Regression 
Linear regression is a statistical method used for predictive analysis. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable by fitting a linear equation to the data.

Multiple Linear Regression extends this concept by modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. This technique allows us to understand how multiple features collectively affect the outcomes.

Steps for Multiple Linear Regression
Steps to perform multiple linear regression are similar to that of simple linear Regression but difference comes in the evaluation process. We can use it to find out which factor has the highest influence on the predicted output and how different variables are related to each other. Equation for multiple linear regression is:
```
y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ⋯ + βₙXₙ
```
- y: Dependent variable (target/outcome)

- β₀: Intercept (constant term)

- β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ: Coefficients/slopes

- X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ: Independent variables (features/predictors)

- ε: Error term (residuals)
